This version of EvtGen is a merger of the latest LHCb and BaBar code.

To build the EvtGen code, do

./configure

then

make

This should create the libraries lib/libEvtGen.so and lib/archive/libEvtGen.a.

Since EvtGen still uses Fortran routines for some calculations gfortran is needed
to compile the code. The alternative (not recommended) compilers g77 (f77) can be
used instead by changing the FC variable in the configure script.

Note that PHOTOS and PYTHIA are required to run EvtGen. Suitable versions are 
available here:

/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/MCGenerators/photos/215.5

/afs/cern.ch/sw/lcg/external/MCGenerators/pythia6/420

To create an EvtGen executable, the following libraries need to be included
in the link path, owing to the dependence on PHOTOS, PYTHIA and Fortran code: 

-lphotos -lpythia6 -lpythia6_dummy -lgfortran

Two example programs using EvtGen can be seen in the test sub-directory along 
with the required Makefile.
