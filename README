RELEASE NOTES 
=============

The major points comparing this version with the last official (2009)
release are the following:

1. This version of EvtGen is a merger of the latest LHCb and BaBar EvtGenBase
   and EvtGenModels code. Most changes since the last release are related to
   bug/compiler fixes.

2. Bug fixes for Bs mixing decay/CP violation amplitudes.
   Added the capability to use either coherent or incoherent mixing in EvtCPUtil. 
   One or the other can be chosen as the mixing method for the B system by
   choosing 0 (coherent) or 1 (incoherent) for the last integer argument 
   in the EvtGen() constructor.

3. The interface to both PYTHIA and PHOTOS are _unchanged_, so it is not
   possible to have multiple instances of either generators within EvtGen,
   since they use FORTRAN code. This will be addressed in the next version 
   of EvtGen.

4. Added two sub-amplitude types LASS_ELASTIC and LASS_RESONANT to the EvtLASSAmp
   model. Also added EvtBaryonPCR and EvtBaryonPCRFF models for baryonic semileptonic 
   decays using more realistic dynamics.

5. Changed EvtWilsonCoeficients to EvtWilsonCoefficients, used in 
   EvtGenModels/EvtLb2Lll.hh.

6. Bug fix correction to EvtTensor4C::cont().


BUILDING THE CODE
=================

To build the EvtGen code, do

./configure

then

make

This should create the libraries lib/libEvtGen.so and lib/archive/libEvtGen.a.

Since EvtGen still uses Fortran routines for some calculations gfortran is needed
to compile the code. The alternative (not recommended) compilers g77 (f77) can be
used instead by changing the FC variable in the configure script.

Note that PHOTOS v2 and PYTHIA v6 are required to run EvtGen. Suitable versions are 
available here: 

PYTHIA  http://projects.hepforge.org/pythia6/

PHOTOS  http://wasm.home.cern.ch/wasm/f77.html

To create an EvtGen executable, the following libraries need to be included
in the link path, owing to the dependence on PHOTOS, PYTHIA and Fortran code: 

-lphotos -lpythia6 -lpythia6_dummy -lgfortran

Two example programs using EvtGen can be seen in the test sub-directory along 
with the required Makefile.
