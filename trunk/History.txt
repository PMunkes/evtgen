R01-01-00-------------------------------------------------------------------
4th October 2012 John Back
     New tag, version "1.1.0", incorporating all changes below.

     Provide proper default constructors for EvtVector4R and 
     EvtPhotonParticle. Modified the validation and test code to also
     compile/link in the case of no external generators being included.

3rd October 2012 John Back
     Corrected the t3 vector form factor values for the Ball-Zwicky '05 
     model (modelId = 6) in EvtbTosllBallFF::getVectorFF(), which
     were set to t3tilde instead.

18th September 2012 John Back
     Moved the external generator engines to a new sub-directory 
     EvtGenExternal. Building the code now creates 2 libraries:
     libEvtGen.so (Base+Models) and libEvtGenExternal.so.
     This allows anyone to ignore using the new external generators
     if required (by not creating/loading the 2nd library).

     Added prefix option to the configure script/Makefile to allow the user 
     to specify an installation directory for the include files, libraries, 
     DECAY.DEC and evt.pdl files (for Genser).

14th September 2012 Michal Kreps
     Fixed the calculation of the angle between decay planes in the function
     EvtKine::EvtDecayAngleChi. Fixed typo in EvtLb2Lll decay model. Only 
     some NP scenarious could be affected, SM one is definitely unaffected.

13th September 2012 John Back
     Added the use of the environment variables EVTGEN_PHOTOS, EVTGEN_PYTHIA 
     and EVTGEN_TAUOLA to specify if the Photos, Pythia and/or Tauola engine
     classes are used or not. These variables are set by the configure script,
     depending if the library paths are specified for these generators.

R01-00-01--------------------------------------------------------------------
12th September 2012 John Back
     New tag incorporating all changes below, since R01-00-00.

11th September 2012 John Back
     Modified the Photos and Tauola engine classes to use the new
     Photospp and Tauolapp namespaces that are present in the latest
     versions of Photos++(3.5) and Tauola++(1.0.7). Updated the configure file 
     to get the correct location of the Tauola++ include files. 

     Added the D0->pi+pi-pi0 decay mode in EvtDDalitz from Marco Gersabeck 
     and Frederic Dreyer (LHCb).

     Added new decay models/classes from Alexey Luchinsky (LHCb):
     EvtBcVMuNu, EvtTVP, EvtWnPi, EvtSVP, EvtXPsiGamma, EvtBcVNpi

29th June 2012 John Back
     Corrected mass(squared) variables filled in the Dalitz TTree in 
     validation/genExampleRootFiles.

15th May 2012 Daniel Craik
     Updated EvtD0gammaDalitz to deal with D mesons from neutral B->DK
     Added save function to validation/compareDalitz.C.

11th May 2012 Daniel Craik
     Replaced BaBar specific configuration for BlattWeisskopf birth factors.
     Updated XML conversion script to handle new configuration.
     Fixed some bugs in the XML conversion script related to particle 
     modifications.

9th May 2012 Daniel Craik
     Added latex documentation for xml decay files.

2nd May 2012 Daniel Craik
     Added resDaughters attribute to the Dalitz resonance xml tag to 
     simplify defining symmetric resonances. Updated validation xml files to 
     use the new functionality.

27th April 2012 Daniel Craik
     Upgraded EvtGenericDalitz to use EvtDalitzReso for resonances.
     Added validation to compare EvtGenericDalitz to all 11 EvtDDalitz modes.
     Added a root macro to quickly compare two Dalitz decays for validation.

24th April 2012 John Back
     Solved two bugs in the EvtD0gammaDalitz model (from Jordi Tico, LHCb):
     configuration of the conjugated model, and using only the B charge
     to determine the model used, not the D flavour.

17th April 2012 Daniel Craik
     Updated the GenericDalitz validation code to use the same probMax 
     values as DDalitz. Added XML decay file parsing to EvtGen::readUDecay.
     Dec files are still the default.

30th March 2012 John Back
     Update maximum probability values in EvtDDalitz::initProbMax()
     for all DDalitz modes.

23rd March 2012 John Back
     Added the EvtEta2MuMuGamma decay model from LHCb.

21st March 2012 John Back
     Added EvtD0gammaDalitz decay model from LHCb.

20th March 2012 Daniel Craik
     Added backwards compatibility for Pythia 6 commands in the XML 
     configuration. Updated decay file conversion tool to convert JetSetPar 
     lines to pythia6Param tags.

19th March 2012 Daniel Craik
     Added infrastructure to pass commands to external generators.
     XML config now takes Pythia8 configuration commands.

16th March 2012 Daniel Craik
     Added the ability to define particles from the PDL for Dalitz decay 
     resonances instead of defining mass, width and spin seperately. Renamed 
     the lifetime attribute of Dalitz decay resonaces to width to avoid 
     confusion. Added further validation code for the generic Dalitz model.

15th March 2012 Daniel Craik
     Added validation code for xml decay files and the generic Dalitz model. 

R01-00-00 ------------------------------------------------------------------
6th March 2012 John Back
    First official version for Genser (evtgen 1.0.0) that includes
    support for external generators: Pythia8, Photos++ and Tauola++. 
    This also includes a preliminary version of creating Dalitz plot
    decay models using EvtGenericDalitz.
